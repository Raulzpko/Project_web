        This is a small reference to the endeavors and great actions of the
        former Covenant general <strong>Thel 'Vadamee</strong> later known as
        <em>the Arbiter</em> or the
        hand (and sword) of the prophets.<br>

      <h3>The Arbiter: A suicidal title</h3>

      <br><em>Thel 'Vadamee</em> was the supreme commander of the Covenant forces
      before the destruction of instalation 04 by Master Chief.<br>
      After his failure to protect the sacred structure the Covenant council
      decided to punish Thel 'Vadamee and all his race (known as the <em>Elites</em>)
      giving 'Vadamee the title of <strong>Arbiter</strong> and his race was removed from
      their task of guardians of the propets and were replaced by the <em>Brutes</em>.

          <span>Heretic! Heretic!</span><br>
          -Tartarus: You have dranwn quite a crowd...<br>
          -Vadamee: if they're here to hear me beg, they will be dissapointed.<br>
          -Tartarus: are you sure?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        At the end, the Arbiter will have his redemption and free his race and
        others along the way from the lies of the prophets and help save the galaxy
        from the flood... for now.
